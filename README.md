Being able to order from a site you can trust.

## User Story

As an avid sneaker shopper I want  an easy to use website that can be saved as a PWA so that I have a more accessible way to shop
Acceptance Criteria:
Given an e-commerce platform for buying shoes
When I view the app’s store
Then I see a front end created with React
When I navigate the app
Then it is interactive and responsive
When I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
Then I find that it passes reducers to a Redux store
When I view the code for the app
Then I see the MERN stack was used
When I save the app to my home screen
Then it functions like a native app
